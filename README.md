## Overview

**Bina Al-Ahliya** is a production-grade, multi-tenant educational platform designed for Islamic schools. It manages the full lifecycle of a student's journey — from platform-level onboarding and school assignment to class placement, curriculum delivery, quizzes, and character-development tracking.

The platform serves **four distinct roles** across separate dashboards, each with granular access control. It is fully bilingual in **Arabic (RTL)** and **Albanian (LTR)**, with dynamic layout direction switching at runtime. Schools are isolated tenants with their own branding, language settings, and assessment configuration.

---

## Key Features

### Platform-Wide

- **Role-based access control** — Four roles (Owner, School Admin, Teacher, Student) with server-enforced route protection
- **Bilingual UI** — Full Arabic (RTL) and Albanian (LTR) support with runtime language switching
- **Token-based invite system** — Secure email invitations for school admins and teachers
- **Complete auth flow** — Sign up, email confirmation, forgot password, and password reset via Supabase Auth
- **Avatar uploads** — Profile photo upload, preview, and removal via Supabase Storage

### Owner (Platform Admin)
- Manage all schools across the platform
- Configure the platform-wide **intake assessment** (the test every new student must pass)

- Manage teachers, students, and classes within the school
- Configure and manage the school's **placement assessment**
- Review placement submissions and assign students to classes
- Generate class and student performance reports with trait analytics
- Community hub moderation

### Teacher
- View assigned classes and student rosters
- Create and publish **quizzes** for their classes
- Post announcements to classes
- Mark student module completions and evaluate **character traits** per module
- Access per-student performance reports
- Participate in the school **community hub**

### Student

```

- **Server Components** handle data fetching and route-level auth checks
- **Client Components** manage interactive UI, forms, and real-time state
- **Route Handlers** (`/api/...`) serve JSON for all data mutations and reads
- **Prisma** connects to PostgreSQL via `@prisma/adapter-pg` (edge-compatible)
- **Supabase** handles authentication sessions (JWT cookies via `@supabase/ssr`) and file storage

---

## Roles & Dashboards

| Role | Entry Point | Key Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `OWNER` | `/owner` | Platform management, school CRUD, intake config, global reviews |
| `SCHOOL_ADMIN` | `/school-admin` | Roadmap builder, class/student/teacher management, placement tests, reports |
| `TEACHER` | `/teacher` | Quiz creation, announcements, trait assessments, student reports |
| `STUDENT` | `/student` | Onboarding pipeline, roadmap learning, quizzes, community hub |

After authentication, users are redirected to their role-specific dashboard via `/auth/callback`. Middleware and layout-level guards enforce role isolation.

---

## Student Onboarding Pipeline

Every new student moves through a strictly ordered pipeline before reaching the main dashboard:

```
PENDING_INTAKE
     │
     ▼ (completes intake assessment)
INTAKE_SUBMITTED ──► Owner reviews → assigns school
     │
     ▼
SCHOOL_ASSIGNED
     │
     ▼ (completes placement assessment)
SCHOOL_PLACEMENT_SUBMITTED ──► Admin reviews → assigns class
     │
     ▼
CLASS_ASSIGNED
     │
     ▼
/student/welcome  ──►  Full dashboard access
```

Each status maps to a protected page. The student layout guard reads `onboarding_status` on every navigation and redirects to the correct step if the student tries to skip ahead.

---

## Database Schema

The platform uses **19 Prisma models** across these domains:

### Users & Schools
| Model | Description |

| `Student` | Links `Profile` → `School` → `Class`, tracks `onboarding_status` |
| `Teacher` | Links `Profile` → `School`, may teach multiple classes |
| `Class` | Belongs to `School`, has one `Teacher` and many `Student`s |

### Assessments
| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `Assessment` | Intake or placement test, owned by platform or school |

```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# ─── Database ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname"

# ─── Supabase ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# ─── Application ───────────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | PostgreSQL connection string for Prisma |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | ✅ | Your Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ✅ | Supabase anonymous (public) key |

## Authentication Flows

### Standard Sign Up
1. User fills the signup form → `supabase.auth.signUp()` is called with `emailRedirectTo: /auth/callback`
2. Supabase sends a confirmation email
3. User clicks the link → `/auth/callback?token_hash=...&type=signup`
4. Server verifies the OTP, fetches the user, syncs the profile email, and redirects to the role dashboard

### Invite-Based Registration (Admins & Teachers)
1. Owner/Admin sends an invite → a signed token record is stored in the DB and an email is dispatched
2. Recipient opens `/invite/[token]` → token is validated and role/school info is shown
3. User sets a password → `supabase.auth.signUp()` is called (sends confirmation email)
4. After email confirmation → profile is created with the correct role and school association

### Password Reset
1. User visits `/forgot-password` → enters email → `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` is called with `redirectTo: /auth/callback`
2. User clicks the email link → `/auth/callback?token_hash=...&type=recovery`
3. **Recovery type is detected early** — redirected immediately to `/reset-password` (skips role lookup)
4. On `/reset-password` the session is validated, and `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })` is called

### Session Management
- Sessions are stored in HTTP-only cookies via `@supabase/ssr`
- `createClient()` (client) and `createClient()` (server) are separate utilities with different cookie strategies
- API routes use the server client to validate the session before every operation

---

## Internationalization

The platform supports two languages, switchable at runtime:

| Language | Code | Direction | Font |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arabic | `ar` | RTL | Cairo |
| Albanian | `sq` | LTR | Cairo |

**How it works:**

- `src/lib/language-context.tsx` exposes a `useLang()` hook that provides `lang` and `setLang`
- Each page that needs translation defines a local `S = { ar: {...}, sq: {...} }` object and picks `T = S[lang]`
- Shared strings (nav labels, quiz terms, etc.) live in `src/lib/translations.ts`
- `dir={lang === "sq" ? "ltr" : "rtl"}` is applied to root `<div>` elements
- Schools can specify a default language; the student layout respects this and offers a toggle when the school uses a non-Arabic language

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

Set all environment variables in the Vercel project dashboard under **Settings → Environment Variables**.

The build command (`npm run build`) runs `prisma generate` automatically before the Next.js build — no extra configuration needed.

### Docker / Self-hosted

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Supabase Setup Checklist

Before deploying, ensure the following are configured in your Supabase project:

- [ ] **Email templates** — Customize confirmation and password-reset emails
- [ ] **Redirect URLs** — Add your production URL to the allow-list in **Auth → URL Configuration**
- [ ] **Storage bucket** — Create a public bucket named `avatars` for profile photos
- [ ] **RLS policies** — Review Row Level Security if you have policies enabled (the app uses the service role key for server-side writes)

### Database Migration

```bash
# Apply schema changes to the production database
npx prisma db push

# Or use migrations for a more controlled workflow
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build     # prisma generate + next build
npm start         # Start production server
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
npx prisma studio # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
```
